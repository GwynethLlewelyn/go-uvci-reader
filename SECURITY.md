## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please don't just add a PR; give me a chance of reviewing the vulnerability first...

Send me the relevant data (general info about what the vulnerability is and how it may be fixed; diffs; links to sites describing the vulnerability, etc.) to [✉️ gwyneth@gwynethllewelyn.net](mailto:gwyneth@gwynethllewelyn.net).

If you wish, you can send me that email encrypted with PGP, my fingerprint can be retrieved at <https://keybase.io/gwynethllewelyn>
